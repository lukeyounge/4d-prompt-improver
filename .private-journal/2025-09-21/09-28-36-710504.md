## Project Notes

Analyzing the AI Fluency Framework PDF visual style for potential integration with the ai-fluency-tool project. The PDF has a clean, professional design with:

Visual Elements:
- Clean white background with subtle gray accent areas
- Sage green colored boxes/cards for the 4D framework components (Delegation, Description, Discernment, Diligence)
- Modern sans-serif typography (appears to be similar to system fonts)
- Anthropic branding in top right
- Hierarchical text sizing with clear information architecture
- Rounded corner cards/boxes for the 4Ds
- Bullet points for the three modes of AI interaction
- Professional layout with good white space

Color Palette:
- Primary: Sage/olive green (#7a8471 or similar)
- Background: Clean white
- Text: Dark gray/black
- Accent areas: Light gray backgrounds

Typography:
- Bold headings for main sections
- Regular weight body text
- Good contrast and readability
- Consistent spacing and hierarchy

This style could work well for the current React app - the green color scheme would complement the existing design, and the card-based layout matches the current component structure. The professional, educational tone aligns perfectly with the "school leaders" target audience.
