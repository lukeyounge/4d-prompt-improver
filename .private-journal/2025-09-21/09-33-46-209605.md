## Project Notes

Successfully applied the AI Fluency Framework PDF visual style to the React web app. Key changes made:

1. **Color Palette**: Updated from blue/purple/green mix to consistent sage/emerald green theme (#emerald-600, #emerald-500, etc.) matching the PDF's professional color scheme

2. **Card-based Layout**: Changed all rounded corners from `rounded-lg` to `rounded-xl` for more pronounced, modern card appearance like the PDF

3. **Typography Hierarchy**: Reduced heading sizes to be more professional and less overwhelming:
   - Main titles: text-4xl → text-3xl, text-3xl → text-2xl
   - Section headings: text-xl → text-lg, text-lg → text-base
   - Better matches the PDF's clean, readable hierarchy

4. **Visual Consistency**: 
   - All cards now use emerald/sage green theme
   - Consistent rounded-xl corners throughout
   - Clean white backgrounds with gray accents
   - Professional, educational appearance

The changes create a much more cohesive, professional look that aligns with the AI Fluency Framework's educational goals and matches the PDF's visual design language. The sage green color palette is particularly effective for the educational/professional target audience of school leaders.
