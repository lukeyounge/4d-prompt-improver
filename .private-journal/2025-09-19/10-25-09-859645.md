## Project Notes

Fixed deployment-blocking TypeScript errors in LivePromptImprovementTool.tsx. The errors were all related to optional chaining - find() methods could return undefined but the code was accessing .input property directly.

Changed patterns like:
`contextInput.input` â†’ `contextInput?.input`

This occurred in multiple locations:
- generateImprovedPrompt function (lines ~150-180)  
- Live prompt preview section (lines ~469-499)
- Enhanced prompt display in improve step (lines ~554-566)

All instances were in similar code blocks that build prompt sections by finding specific improvement inputs and accessing their .input property. The fix was consistent across all locations.

Build now passes cleanly and code is pushed to main branch ready for Vercel deployment.
