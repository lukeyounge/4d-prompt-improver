## Project Notes

Replaced static API comparison with interactive chatbot based on user insight that enhanced prompts are designed for collaboration and should demonstrate that through conversation.

The chatbot implementation:
- New /api/chat endpoint in app/api/chat/route.ts
- Chat state management in LivePromptImprovementTool.tsx
- Message history UI with proper styling
- Integration with enhanced prompt as conversation starter
- Error handling and loading states

This is much more educational for school leaders - they can see how their enhanced prompts actually change AI behavior in real-time conversation, not just in static outputs. The back-and-forth demonstrates the collaborative nature that the 3P framework enables.

User's insight was spot-on: enhanced prompts that ask for clarifying questions need interactive demonstration, not side-by-side comparison.
