## Project Notes

Successfully replaced the ineffective Riddle Exchange game with "Odd One Out" game for the discernment phase. User feedback was spot-on that Claude solving riddles immediately made it a poor discernment training tool.

The Odd One Out game is much better because:
- Multiple valid answers exist (e.g., "potato" could be odd because it's a vegetable vs fruits, or "grape" because it's small vs large items)
- Users practice evaluating reasoning quality, not just finding correct answers
- Forces evaluation of logic strength rather than binary right/wrong
- More engaging and educational for discernment skills

Technical implementation:
- Updated game state management from riddle-based to item-based
- Added evaluation system with "Strong/Weak/Flimsy Logic" buttons  
- Implemented multiple answer request functionality
- Created 5 example item sets plus custom input capability
- Updated all UI components and reflection questions
- Maintained same game flow: setup → playing → completed

Key architecture decisions:
- Used same API pattern as other games for consistency
- Added userEvaluation property to track user feedback
- Limited to 3 rounds to prevent endless cycling
- Added progress indicators and completion logic

This demonstrates the importance of user feedback in iterative design - the user correctly identified that the riddle approach was fundamentally flawed for teaching discernment skills.
